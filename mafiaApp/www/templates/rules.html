            <h2 style="text-align: center;">THE OBECTIVE</h2>
				<p style="text-align: center;">Each session of Mafia consists of seven Players. Each Player is randomly assigned a Role. Each session consists of two Mafioso, one Cop, one Medic, and three Vanilla. The Mafioso are on the Mafia team and the other Roles are all on the Town team. The last team remaining with at least one member wins the game.</p>
			<h2 style="text-align: center;">THE ROLES</h2>
				<p>MAFIOSO - Capable of killing off one Town member per Night. The decision to kill off a certain Player must be a unanimous decision made by all surviving members of the Mafia team. Deciding to not kill of any Players in a given Night is a valid and sometimes strategic decision.</p>
				<p>COP - Capable of choosing one Player per Night of whom they wish to &quot;see&quot;. They are shown the Role of the Player that they have chosen. Choosing to not pick anyone in a given Night is a valid choice, though unwise.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>MEDIC - Capable of saving one Player per Night. The Player they choose is immune to to any Mafia attack that they may or may not have become victim to in that Night. If a Player that was chosen to be killed by the Mafia is also chosen to be saved by the Medic, then no one will have died that Night. Choosing to save no one in a given Night is a valid and sometimes strategic decision.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>VANILLA - Players who are Vanilla are plain Townspeople who have no special ability at Night. They have to click a dummy button so that other Players do not differntiate between them at Night.&nbsp;</p>
			<h2 style="text-align: center;">THE GAME</h2>
				<p style="text-align: center;">The game cycles between Night and Day until one team is eliminated and the game is over. During Night, all Players are prompted to perform some action that is dependent on their Role. During Day, all Players are told who, if anyone, was killed by the Mafia the Night before. All surviving Players are then allowed to vote off a Player whom the majority believe may be a part of the Mafia.&nbsp;</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;">First, all Players choose a Player they would like to nominate. The first Player to receive two nominations is put up to a vote. That Player is then allowed to try to convince other Players to not vote them off. If the majority of remaining Players vote to kill off the Player, they are eliminated. Otherwise, no one is killed and Night follows.&nbsp;</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;">In the rare event that a Day occurs with one Mafioso and one Townsperson, the Town wins since the Townsperson knows for certain that the remaining Player must be a Mafioso.</p>
