            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Setup</h2>
				<p style="text-align: center;">The game is played with seven players. They are divided into two teams: the Town, and the Mafia. Every player is assigned a role. The Town consists of a Cop, a Medic, and three Vanilla, and the Mafia consists of two Mafioso. Mafia members know who their partner is, but members of Town only know their own role. This lack of knowledge is what drives the game forward. As players question each other in order to discern the identity of the Mafia, anyone could be lying about what side they are truly on. This means players have to think critically about each player’s actions and statements, and look for clues that would give away a lie. Each Night has a 12 second timer, Day has a 12 second timer, and the formal has a 8 second timer.</p>
			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Gameplay</h2>
				<p>The game is divided into two phases: Day and Night. Every Night, the roles on both teams pick a target in the night. The Mafioso attempt to <i>kill</i> that person, the Cop attempts to <i>check</i> that person, the Medic attempts to <i>save</i> that person, and the Vanillas do nothing. The Mafia team can only kill one person during the night, so the Mafioso must agree on who to kill. If the Mafia pick a target who is also picked by the Medic, that player does not die. Selecting nobody in the night is also a valid strategy for the Mafioso and Medic. The Cop’s check will tell him what team his target is on: the Town or Mafia. Then, during the next day, the Town discusses who they suspect was behind the murder. At any point during the day, players may accuse each other of being Mafia. Eventually, Town votes to <i>lynch</i> whoever they believe is the most likely to be Mafia based on evidence and arguments of all players. This is done by putting them under <i>formal</i> and counting the votes on them at the end of the timer. After a formal it goes to Night.</p>
			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Game Over</h2>
				<p style="text-align: center;">Players who are killed are out for the rest of the game. They are not allowed to vote or discuss the game. After death, a player’s role is displayed to all other players in the game: this is known as a <i>role-flip</i>. When all of the mafia are eliminated, Town wins. However, if the number of Town and Mafia players were match, Mafia wins. This is because Mafia can never be lynched due to the fact that Town do not hold the majority of players in the game, so Mafia will just always vote no on killing each other. It does not matter if you are alive or dead when the game is over: the results of your team is your result.&nbsp;</p>
